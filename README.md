## General ideology across projects

When I create something that could be helpful for other people,  it's shared publicly with the world (you!)

### No guarantees when it comes to response times

Since this is something completely done in my freetime, response time (e.g. when I am on vacation etc.) will be sometimes slower.
Nevertheless, I always try to deliver fast and respond quickly to questions/issues/feedback etc. 


### Stale projects wont get deleted

Whenever a project is discontinued, for whatever reason it **will not be deleted** but rather archived. This way you can have confidence that projects maintained by me will just disappear. Of course also feel free to fork it anyway.


### Feature requests

Feature requests will be carefully evaluated by me, and I reverse the right to decline requests that either not comply with the overall goal of a project or my opinion.
